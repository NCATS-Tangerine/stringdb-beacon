# stringdb-beacon

Knowledge Beacon Wrapper for the StringDb resource (https://string-db.org/)

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses a modified version of the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library (located at /extras/connexion) on top of Flask.

## Running with Docker

Use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to build and run the application. The host machines `NEO4J_AUTH` environment variable is passed into the docker containers. If it is not set then it will default to neo4j/password. Linux users can do this in the terminal with the following commands:

```
cd stringdb-beacon
docker-compose build
export NEO4J_AUTH=<username>/<password>
docker-compose up
```

> **Note:** If you don't wish to set a password, you can simply not expose the database container's ports to your host machine. You can control which ports, if any at all, are exposed with the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

The Neo4j container's data, import, logs, and config directories will be mounted on the host machine at `$HOME/neo4j`. All the data in the database, including the username and password, will persist in the `$HOME/neo4j/data` directory over multiple runs of the container.

If the docker-compose commands are is giving you trouble, try running them as the system administrator with the `sudo` command.

The API should now be running at http://localhost:5000/api, and the Neo4j browser user interface should be running at http://localhost:7474. You can open your browser with these addresses to see these applications in action. You wont see much until you load data into the database, though.

## Loading Data

String-db hosts its database at https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl. You can get subsets of the database by selecting a species, so far we have only been using *Homo sapiens*. There is a python script `extras/neo4j/download_stringdb_data.py` that can be used to download, unzip, and properly format the data for *Homo sapiens*. This script must be run with version 3 of python, in the terminal run `python --version` to check your version. If you will not be using this script you will need to manually fix TSV headers in some of the data files.

If you have used docker-compose to run the application, you will have a `neo4j/import` directory mounted in your home directory. We will need to download TSV files from string-db, and place them in this import directory.

Your Neo4j docker container should be named stringdbbeacon_db_1, run `docker-compose ps` to confirm this. We will execute the load.cql file, in the `extras/neo4j` directory, using the Neo4j shell.

```
docker exec -i stringdbbeacon_db_1 /var/lib/neo4j/bin/neo4j-shell -c < load.cql
```

> **Note:** If you see `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, then you may need to increase the Java heap size with the `_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable in `docker-compose.yaml`.


## Issues

This beacon is a work in progress. Here are a few points that still need to be addressed
- So far the evidence and exactmatches API are not implemented.
- I have only been using data for *Homo sapiens*. We should also include mouse, rat, yeast, c. elegans, drosphila, and zebrafish species as well, to complement monarch biolink.
- I have only been using data for protein aliases and actions. Once we introduce other species we will also need to use `species.v10.5.txt` which is available in the download section of string-db. Even so, these are only three out of the many data files offered by string-db. Someone who is more familiar with the data should go through all of the data files and build up a better data model.
